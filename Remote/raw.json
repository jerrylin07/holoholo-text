"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_00_02", "We’ve researched wondrous Pokémon from regions near and far, triumphed over the troublesome Team GO Rocket, and forged some excellent friendships along the way.",

"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_03", "A fact which leads me to conclude that some of these blossoms nearby could actually be our Shaymin, hiding in plain sight!",
"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_01_04", "Since Land Forme Shaymin is a Grass type, let’s gather some Grass-type Pokémon for observation and research. Comparing their behaviors might provide valuable insights.",

"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_01", "Erm... Well, I remembered a little factoid: the flowers on Shaymin’s body will burst into bloom if it is lovingly hugged and can sense gratitude.",
"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_02", "Which is why I figured I’d try my luck hugging some flower patches. Makes total sense, right? Sadly, I didn’t find Shaymin. But as they say, you can only learn through trial and error!",
"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_03", "Anyway, I promised to share more Shaymin facts, didn’t I? Here’s a nugget of knowledge for you!",
"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_02_04", "Upon taking in the scent of a particular rare flower, Shaymin is enveloped in light—its tiny body changes into its Sky Forme, giving it the power of flight! Wouldn’t that be a sight to see?",

"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_03_03", "Now then, you’ll want to be ready to catch Shaymin when it finally does appear, so now’s the time to train up!",

"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_01", "And if we practice some acts of gratitude ourselves, we might just coax our floral friend out of hiding. It’s a win-win!",
"go_tour_2024_masterwork_sr_dialog_04_02", "I’ve always found giving back to my friends deeply rewarding. And I’ll bet your friends would appreciate some Gifts too!",
