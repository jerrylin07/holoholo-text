"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_3", "Fascinating, isn’t it? Let’s test the theories out and evolve a Bagon!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_0", "And what have we here, %PLAYERNAME%? Well, well, it’s Shelgon, the Endurance Pokémon! Excellent work.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_1", "Shelgon’s shell is iron-hard and repels enemy attacks. When it’s waiting to evolve, it often hides away in a cavern.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_2", "And while it’s shut up in its shell, I hear it still dreams of the day it’ll be able to fly.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_3", "Why don’t we give your Shelgon a helping hand to see what new heights—literally—it can reach?",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_0", "Impressive! You helped Shelgon’s dreams come true!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_1", "Salamence are overjoyed that they can finally take wing. They fly all over the place and usually don’t land until they’re completely exhausted and need to sleep.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_2", "I must say, this does open up all kinds of questions about what else Dragon-type Pokémon are capable of. It’s really inspiring.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_3", "And while I don’t recommend you bang your head into rocks to make your dreams come true, I’m sure the sky’s the limit for you too, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_0", "Hello there, %PLAYERNAME%! Have you happened to do any exploring today?",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_1", "It’s quite the sight, let me tell you! It’s lousy with Bellsprout out there!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_2", "They tend to prefer hot and humid places, but right now they seem to be everywhere.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_0_3", "And you know, there’s still plenty for us to learn about the Flower Pokémon. Would you be a pal and catch one for us to study?",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_0", "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%. And what a great specimen you’ve brought!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_1", "Did you know that despite their slender frames, they can move lightning fast to catch insects? One more reason to be glad we’re not bugs!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_2", "But there’s more for us to learn about this fascinating Pokémon! Drop by again after you’ve evolved your Bellsprout into Weepinbell.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_1_3", "I’ll leaf through my Weepinbell research notes so I’m ready for you when you get back!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_0", "Hey now, that’s got to be the Weepinbell of the ball! Let me take a closer look.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_1", "Aha! You see that large hook on its rear end? Weepinbell tend to use that to hook themselves on tree branches when they sleep.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_2", "In other words, if you see your Weepinbell yawning, find it a tree on the double!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_2_3", "But there’s no time for us to be snoozing. How about you evolve Weepinbell into a Victreebel and bring it back here?",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_0", "Hey, you’re victree-orious! Vic-tree...riffic? Ahem. Let’s have a look at your Victreebell, %PLAYERNAME%.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_1", "These large, plant-like Pokémon live in huge colonies, deep within the jungle. No one who’s visited has returned to tell the tale. That’s sure foreboding!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_2", "Although if I put my professor cap on and think about it, how do we know about the colonies unless someone DID make it back?",
"quest_special_dialogue_bellsprout_3_3", "There’s something to ponder! In the meantime, thanks for letting me observe your Victreebel. I’m sure you’ll be fast friends in no time—just watch out for that prey-dissolving acid!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_0", "Aha! I hoped we’d have a run-in today, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_1", "I was out hiking earlier when I saw a quick flash of something in the trees—something unusual.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_2", "I can’t say for certain, but it may have been the Mythical Pokémon Zarude! Or possibly just some falling leaves.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_3", "Either way, would you keep an eye—or even two—out for any unusual Grass-type Pokémon while you’re exploring?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, just the person I wanted to see!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_1", "I managed to spot our elusive friend again, and I can confirm that it’s definitely a Pokémon!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_2", "Unfortunately, it zipped away before I could get a closer look. Why don’t you canvas the area?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_3", "In the meantime, I’ll put my nose to my notes and see if I can’t confirm its identity.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_0", "Excellent, you’re back! I’ve got fantastic news, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_1", "After digging into my archives, I can confirm that this mystery Pokémon is indeed none other than the Mythical Pokémon Zarude!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_2", "They tend to move in packs, but I can’t be certain how many we’re dealing with. It doesn’t matter, though. Either way, we must approach carefully!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_3", "I’m going to dive back into research and uncover whatever I can about Zarude’s behavior to help you prepare for this encounter.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_0", "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I have some super interesting tidbits to share about our elusive friend, Zarude!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_1", "When the vines on its body are torn off, they enrich the soil, and cause plants to grow large and lush.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_2", "Interesting, right? And useful, too! Do be on the lookout for any unusually lush areas—that could indicate a Zarude is close by!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_3", "You take care of that and let me know what you find. I’ll take some more time to study up.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, thanks to your exemplary field work, we’ve managed to locate the exact location of our Zarude.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_1", "I don’t think I have to remind you to be careful—it’s incredibly aggressive, and other forest Pokémon fear it. But I’m sure a talented Trainer like you can earn its trust in no time.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_2", "Just treat it like any other Pokémon—approach with patience and an open heart. Then I’m sure you’ll have yourself a steadfast new companion!",
