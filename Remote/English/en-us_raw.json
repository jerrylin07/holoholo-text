"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_0", "Impressive! You helped Shelgon’s dreams come true!",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_1", "Salamence are overjoyed that they can finally take wing. They fly all over the place and usually don’t land until they’re completely exhausted and need to sleep.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_2", "I must say, this does open up all kinds of questions about what else Dragon-type Pokémon are capable of. It’s really inspiring.",
"quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_3", "And while I don’t recommend you bang your head into rocks to make your dreams come true, I’m sure the sky’s the limit for you too, %PLAYERNAME%!",

"quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_1", "Then the strangest coincidence happened—when I woke up, there were more Litten around than usual!",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_2", "I’d love to observe them more closely, but it takes time to get them to trust you, so it’s easier said than done.",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_3", "But I bet with that spark and determination of yours, you just might be able to get some of them to warm up to you.",

"quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_3", "Tell you what—why don’t you try evolving Litten into Torracat, then fill me in on what you learn in the process of building your friendship.",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_0", "Brilliant work, Trainer! Let’s have a look at your fiery new Torracat.",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_1", "Take a peek at its throat—see that bell of flame? It rings brightly whenever Torracat spits fire.",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_2", "It also boasts powerful front legs. With a single punch, it can bend an iron bar right over!",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_3", "How about we help this fur-ocious fighter burn even brighter?",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_0", "Whew! Why do I feel like I’m about to melt?! Oh—you’ve evolved your Torracat into Incineroar!",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_1", "Did you know the temperature of the flames from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit? And that’s not all!",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_2", "Incineroar is equally formidable when it’s hurling ferocious punches or flinging furious kicks! Speaking of formidable, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve really evolved into quite the Trainer yourself.",
"quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_3", "I can’t wait to see how much further you’ll go. Until next time, keep that fire of yours burning hot!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_0", "Aha! I hoped we’d have a run-in today, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_1", "I was out hiking earlier when I saw a quick flash of something in the trees—something unusual.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_2", "I can’t say for certain, but it may have been the Mythical Pokémon Zarude! Or possibly just some falling leaves.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_3", "Either way, would you keep an eye—or even two—out for any unusual Grass-type Pokémon while you’re exploring?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, just the person I wanted to see!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_1", "I managed to spot our elusive friend again, and I can confirm that it’s definitely a Pokémon!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_2", "Unfortunately, it zipped away before I could get a closer look. Why don’t you canvas the area?",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_3", "In the meantime, I’ll put my nose to my notes and see if I can’t confirm its identity.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_0", "Excellent, you’re back! I’ve got fantastic news, %PLAYERNAME%!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_1", "After digging into my archives, I can confirm that this mystery Pokémon is indeed none other than the Mythical Pokémon Zarude!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_2", "They tend to move in packs, but I can’t be certain how many we’re dealing with. It doesn’t matter, though. Either way, we must approach carefully!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_3", "I’m going to dive back into research and uncover whatever I can about Zarude’s behavior to help you prepare for this encounter.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_0", "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I have some super interesting tidbits to share about our elusive friend, Zarude!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_1", "When the vines on its body are torn off, they enrich the soil, and cause plants to grow large and lush.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_2", "Interesting, right? And useful, too! Do be on the lookout for any unusually lush areas—that could indicate a Zarude is close by!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_3", "You take care of that and let me know what you find. I’ll take some more time to study up.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_0", "%PLAYERNAME%, thanks to your exemplary field work, we’ve managed to locate the exact location of our Zarude.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_1", "I don’t think I have to remind you to be careful—it’s incredibly aggressive, and other forest Pokémon fear it. But I’m sure a talented Trainer like you can earn its trust in no time.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_2", "Just treat it like any other Pokémon—approach with patience and an open heart. Then I’m sure you’ll have yourself a steadfast new companion!",
