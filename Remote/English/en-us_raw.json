"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_1", "After digging into my archives, I can confirm that this mystery Pokémon is indeed none other than the Mythical Pokémon Zarude!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_2", "They tend to move in packs, but I can’t be certain how many we’re dealing with. It doesn’t matter, though. Either way, we must approach carefully!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_3", "I’m going to dive back into research and uncover whatever I can about Zarude’s behavior to help you prepare for this encounter.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_0", "Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I have some super interesting tidbits to share about our elusive friend, Zarude!",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_1", "When the vines on its body are torn off, they enrich the soil, and cause plants to grow large and lush.",
"quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_2", "Interesting, right? And useful, too! Do be on the lookout for any unusually lush areas—that could indicate a Zarude is close by!",
