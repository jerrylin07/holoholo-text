RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_1
TEXT: Then the strangest coincidence happened—when I woke up, there were more Litten around than usual!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_2
TEXT: I’d love to observe them more closely, but it takes time to get them to trust you, so it’s easier said than done.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_0_3
TEXT: But I bet with that spark and determination of yours, you just might be able to get some of them to warm up to you.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_0
TEXT: Color me impressed! It’s amazing that you managed to gain their trust so quickly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_1
TEXT: For my part, I just can’t help smothering Litten with attention—though I’m sure they’d rather I didn’t.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_2

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_1_3
TEXT: Tell you what—why don’t you try evolving Litten into Torracat, then fill me in on what you learn in the process of building your friendship.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_0
TEXT: Brilliant work, Trainer! Let’s have a look at your fiery new Torracat.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_1
TEXT: Take a peek at its throat—see that bell of flame? It rings brightly whenever Torracat spits fire.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_2
TEXT: It also boasts powerful front legs. With a single punch, it can bend an iron bar right over!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_2_3
TEXT: How about we help this fur-ocious fighter burn even brighter?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_0
TEXT: Whew! Why do I feel like I’m about to melt?! Oh—you’ve evolved your Torracat into Incineroar!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_1
TEXT: Did you know the temperature of the flames from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit? And that’s not all!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_2
TEXT: Incineroar is equally formidable when it’s hurling ferocious punches or flinging furious kicks! Speaking of formidable, %PLAYERNAME%—you’ve really evolved into quite the Trainer yourself.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_litten_3_3
TEXT: I can’t wait to see how much further you’ll go. Until next time, keep that fire of yours burning hot!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_0
TEXT: Aha! I hoped we’d have a run-in today, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_1
TEXT: I was out hiking earlier when I saw a quick flash of something in the trees—something unusual.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_2
TEXT: I can’t say for certain, but it may have been the Mythical Pokémon Zarude! Or possibly just some falling leaves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_3
TEXT: Either way, would you keep an eye—or even two—out for any unusual Grass-type Pokémon while you’re exploring?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, just the person I wanted to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_1
TEXT: I managed to spot our elusive friend again, and I can confirm that it’s definitely a Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_2
TEXT: Unfortunately, it zipped away before I could get a closer look. Why don’t you canvas the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_3
TEXT: In the meantime, I’ll put my nose to my notes and see if I can’t confirm its identity.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_0
TEXT: Excellent, you’re back! I’ve got fantastic news, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_1
TEXT: After digging into my archives, I can confirm that this mystery Pokémon is indeed none other than the Mythical Pokémon Zarude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_2
TEXT: They tend to move in packs, but I can’t be certain how many we’re dealing with. It doesn’t matter, though. Either way, we must approach carefully!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_3
TEXT: I’m going to dive back into research and uncover whatever I can about Zarude’s behavior to help you prepare for this encounter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I have some super interesting tidbits to share about our elusive friend, Zarude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_1
TEXT: When the vines on its body are torn off, they enrich the soil, and cause plants to grow large and lush.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_2
TEXT: Interesting, right? And useful, too! Do be on the lookout for any unusually lush areas—that could indicate a Zarude is close by!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_3
TEXT: You take care of that and let me know what you find. I’ll take some more time to study up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, thanks to your exemplary field work, we’ve managed to locate the exact location of our Zarude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_1
TEXT: I don’t think I have to remind you to be careful—it’s incredibly aggressive, and other forest Pokémon fear it. But I’m sure a talented Trainer like you can earn its trust in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_2
TEXT: Just treat it like any other Pokémon—approach with patience and an open heart. Then I’m sure you’ll have yourself a steadfast new companion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_3
TEXT: Great work so far, and good luck with what’s to come!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_0_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket members have been popping up in greater numbers—and you and I both know that wherever those troublemakers are, chaos is sure to follow.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_0_2
TEXT: We need more info. Why don’t you go confront some of them and see what intel you can get your hands on?

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_0_3
TEXT: The more we learn, the better prepared we’ll be to stop them—that’s the power of knowledge!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_1_0
TEXT: Those Team GO Rocket Grunts weren’t the chatty sort, were they, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_1_1
TEXT: Not to worry! We’ll just cut right to the source and find where their rabble-rousing leaders are hiding!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_1_2
TEXT: But until we can track them down, keep seeking out Grunts and purify any Shadow Pokémon you come across. Rescuing them from those rascals is a top priority.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_1_3
TEXT: I know a Trainer like you is more than up to the task!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_2_0
TEXT: Great work out there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wish I could say I did as well with my own search here.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_2_1
TEXT: Sadly, I haven’t been able to track down Team GO Rocket’s leaders—Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra. Not to worry, though! Any professor worth their salt always has a plan B!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_2_2
TEXT: If you can collect some Mysterious Components, we’ll be able to knock together a Rocket Radar!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_2_3
TEXT: With top-tier tech like that in our hands, there’s no way those miscreants will be able to hide from us.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_3_0
TEXT: Amazing work, %PLAYERNAME%! You really gave those Team GO Rocket leaders what for!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_3_1
TEXT: That said, even putting their leaders out of commission hasn’t put a stop to Team GO Rocket’s activity. Which means we’ll need to escalate our little issue all the way to the top—to Giovanni.
