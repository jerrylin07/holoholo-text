RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_0
TEXT: Hmm, I see... And then... Mm-hmm... Oh! Good to see you, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_1
TEXT: I was totally absorbed in my investigation of a most curious phenomenon in the area. Maybe you’ve noticed it yourself?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_2
TEXT: You know—the large boulders all over and the pieces of rock that look like they were broken off?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_0_3
TEXT: Perhaps you can help put some fire to all the smoke. Would you mind canvassing the area and letting me know if you find anything noteworthy?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_0
TEXT: Aha! Looks like Bagon, the Rock Head Pokémon, is responsible for the recent rocky wreckage.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_1
TEXT: Bagon aspire to one day soar through the sky. As if trying to dispel their frustration over their inability to do so, they slam their hard heads against huge rocks, shattering them into pebbles.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_2
TEXT: In fact, there are some theories that suggest this head-bashing behavior stimulates cells that affect their evolution!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_1_3
TEXT: Fascinating, isn’t it? Let’s test the theories out and evolve a Bagon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_0
TEXT: And what have we here, %PLAYERNAME%? Well, well, it’s Shelgon, the Endurance Pokémon! Excellent work.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_1
TEXT: Shelgon’s shell is iron-hard and repels enemy attacks. When it’s waiting to evolve, it often hides away in a cavern.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_2
TEXT: And while it’s shut up in its shell, I hear it still dreams of the day it’ll be able to fly.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_2_3
TEXT: Why don’t we give your Shelgon a helping hand to see what new heights—literally—it can reach?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_0
TEXT: Impressive! You helped Shelgon’s dreams come true!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_1
TEXT: Salamence are overjoyed that they can finally take wing. They fly all over the place and usually don’t land until they’re completely exhausted and need to sleep.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_2
TEXT: I must say, this does open up all kinds of questions about what else Dragon-type Pokémon are capable of. It’s really inspiring.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_bagon_3_3
TEXT: And while I don’t recommend you bang your head into rocks to make your dreams come true, I’m sure the sky’s the limit for you too, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_0
TEXT: Aha! I hoped we’d have a run-in today, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_1
TEXT: I was out hiking earlier when I saw a quick flash of something in the trees—something unusual.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_2
TEXT: I can’t say for certain, but it may have been the Mythical Pokémon Zarude! Or possibly just some falling leaves.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_0_3
TEXT: Either way, would you keep an eye—or even two—out for any unusual Grass-type Pokémon while you’re exploring?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, just the person I wanted to see!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_1
TEXT: I managed to spot our elusive friend again, and I can confirm that it’s definitely a Pokémon!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_2
TEXT: Unfortunately, it zipped away before I could get a closer look. Why don’t you canvas the area?

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_1_3
TEXT: In the meantime, I’ll put my nose to my notes and see if I can’t confirm its identity.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_0
TEXT: Excellent, you’re back! I’ve got fantastic news, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_1
TEXT: After digging into my archives, I can confirm that this mystery Pokémon is indeed none other than the Mythical Pokémon Zarude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_2
TEXT: They tend to move in packs, but I can’t be certain how many we’re dealing with. It doesn’t matter, though. Either way, we must approach carefully!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_2_3
TEXT: I’m going to dive back into research and uncover whatever I can about Zarude’s behavior to help you prepare for this encounter.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_0
TEXT: Welcome back, %PLAYERNAME%! I have some super interesting tidbits to share about our elusive friend, Zarude!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_1
TEXT: When the vines on its body are torn off, they enrich the soil, and cause plants to grow large and lush.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_2
TEXT: Interesting, right? And useful, too! Do be on the lookout for any unusually lush areas—that could indicate a Zarude is close by!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_3_3
TEXT: You take care of that and let me know what you find. I’ll take some more time to study up.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_0
TEXT: %PLAYERNAME%, thanks to your exemplary field work, we’ve managed to locate the exact location of our Zarude.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_1
TEXT: I don’t think I have to remind you to be careful—it’s incredibly aggressive, and other forest Pokémon fear it. But I’m sure a talented Trainer like you can earn its trust in no time.

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_2
TEXT: Just treat it like any other Pokémon—approach with patience and an open heart. Then I’m sure you’ll have yourself a steadfast new companion!

RESOURCE ID: quest_special_dialogue_rogue_jungle_4_3
TEXT: Great work so far, and good luck with what’s to come!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_0_0

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_0_1
TEXT: Team GO Rocket members have been popping up in greater numbers—and you and I both know that wherever those troublemakers are, chaos is sure to follow.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_0_2
TEXT: We need more info. Why don’t you go confront some of them and see what intel you can get your hands on?

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_0_3
TEXT: The more we learn, the better prepared we’ll be to stop them—that’s the power of knowledge!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_1_0
TEXT: Those Team GO Rocket Grunts weren’t the chatty sort, were they, %PLAYERNAME%?

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_1_1
TEXT: Not to worry! We’ll just cut right to the source and find where their rabble-rousing leaders are hiding!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_1_2
TEXT: But until we can track them down, keep seeking out Grunts and purify any Shadow Pokémon you come across. Rescuing them from those rascals is a top priority.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_1_3
TEXT: I know a Trainer like you is more than up to the task!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_2_0
TEXT: Great work out there, %PLAYERNAME%! I wish I could say I did as well with my own search here.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_2_1
TEXT: Sadly, I haven’t been able to track down Team GO Rocket’s leaders—Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra. Not to worry, though! Any professor worth their salt always has a plan B!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_2_2
TEXT: If you can collect some Mysterious Components, we’ll be able to knock together a Rocket Radar!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_2_3
TEXT: With top-tier tech like that in our hands, there’s no way those miscreants will be able to hide from us.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_3_0
TEXT: Amazing work, %PLAYERNAME%! You really gave those Team GO Rocket leaders what for!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_3_1
TEXT: That said, even putting their leaders out of commission hasn’t put a stop to Team GO Rocket’s activity. Which means we’ll need to escalate our little issue all the way to the top—to Giovanni.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_3_2
TEXT: Be careful, though. He’s more powerful than any other member of Team GO Rocket. But if there’s anyone who can put him in his place, it’s you.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_3_3
TEXT: Good luck, %PLAYERNAME%!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_4_0
TEXT: Kudos to you, %PLAYERNAME%! You showed Giovanni and his band of bullies and malcontents that they aren’t welcome around here!

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_4_1
TEXT: ...For now, at least. There’s not a doubt in my mind that those louts will be back eventually. But at least for now, the Pokémon in this area are safe, and we have you to thank.

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_4_2
TEXT: A victory like this calls for a celebration—perhaps a nice bowl of Pinap Berries?

RESOURCE ID: story_rockethq14_4_3
